- FIX: Bots will no longer attempt to revive teammates who are already being revived

- PORT?: Bots can melee enemies, knocking them down and dealing half of their health in damage ?

- PORT?: Additionally, bots will not mark enemies who are already marked, increasing the variety of marked enemies; the code for marking has also been improved for efficiency ?

- PORT?: Further, bots' movement penalty when carrying bags is now similar to human players ??

- PORT?: Bots will automatically reload their weapons if they are out of combat and their magazines are at least half empty, rather than only reloading when their mags are totally dry

- PORT?: Bots' targeting has been overhauled, prioritizing enemies based on distance and focusing on specials

- PORT?: Forcing bots to 'mask up' immediately when a loud sound is made, rather than waiting for the actual alarm

- select bot weapons? select bot clothing?
- 'keepers' features? (tell bots to stay in place / defend a specific area etc) [loud]
- improve grenades somehow?
- improve: bots properly secure loot (throw) ??
